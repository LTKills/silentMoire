Moiré pattern denoiser for scanned photos

## In other words...

You are too lazy to take a proper screenshot of your screen. You see your phone nearby and decide to do the most stupid thing ever: take a pic of your screen using your phone's camera. You end up with this:

Using silentMoire you'll be able to restore the image back to this:

We've all been there. Enter silentMoire:

[description about Moire Patterns]

## Abstract

Whenever one tries to take a picture of a screen or monitor they always end up with some weird patterns in them. These patterns, the Moiré patterns, can be removed by using image restoration techniques. The aim of this project is to create an application that allows the user to easily denoise his/her scanned photo in order to remove this kind of pattern.
