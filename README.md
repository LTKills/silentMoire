Moiré pattern denoiser for scanned photos


## The problem (or Abstract)

Whenever you try to take a picture of a screen or monitor they always end up with some weird patterns. These patterns, the Moiré patterns, can be removed by using image restoration techniques. The aim of this project is to create an application that allows you to easily denoise your scanned pictures in order to remove this types of patterns.


## In other words...

You are too lazy to take a proper screenshot of your screen. You see your phone nearby and decide to do the most stupid thing ever: take a pic of your screen with your phone. You end up with this:

We've all been there. Enter silentMoire: using silentMoire you should be able to restore the image back to something more like the original picture:
